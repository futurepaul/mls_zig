**Implementation Files**: ‚úÖ `src/leaf_node.zig` ‚Üí ‚úÖ `src/tree_kem.zig` ‚Üí üöß `src/mls_group.zig`

## Notes
- TreeMath implemented in `src/tree_math.zig`
- Binary tree structure implemented in `src/binary_tree.zig`
- Tree diff operations implemented in `src/binary_tree_diff.zig`
- TLS codec framework implemented in `src/tls_codec.zig`
- Credential types implemented in `src/credentials.zig`
- Cipher suites and crypto primitives implemented in `src/cipher_suite.zig`
- Key packages and signature operations implemented in `src/key_package.zig`
- All index types use wrapper structs around u32
- TreeNodeIndex is a union(enum) in Zig vs enum in Rust
- Method names changed from `u32()` to `asU32()` to avoid shadowing primitives
- BinaryTree uses generic types for leaf and parent node data
- Iterators return typed structs (LeafItem/ParentItem) instead of anonymous structs
- Diff system uses HashMaps for tracking changes instead of BTreeMap
- Tree growing doubles leaf count, shrinking halves it (maintains full binary tree property)
- TLS codec follows MLS/TLS conventions (big-endian, length-prefixed data)
- VarBytes manages memory automatically for variable-length data
- HPKE encryption using zig-hpke library for path secret protection
- TreeSync wrapper provides high-level tree operations over BinaryTree
- External dependencies managed through build.zig.zon and build.zig
