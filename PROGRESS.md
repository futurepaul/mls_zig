## Notes

- All index types use wrapper structs around u32
- TreeNodeIndex is a union(enum) in Zig vs enum in Rust
- Method names changed from `u32()` to `asU32()` to avoid shadowing primitives
- BinaryTree uses generic types for leaf and parent node data
- Iterators return typed structs (LeafItem/ParentItem) instead of anonymous structs
- Diff system uses HashMaps for tracking changes instead of BTreeMap
- Tree growing doubles leaf count, shrinking halves it (maintains full binary tree property)
- TLS codec follows MLS/TLS conventions (big-endian, length-prefixed data)
- VarBytes manages memory automatically for variable-length data
- HPKE encryption using zig-hpke library for path secret protection
- TreeSync wrapper provides high-level tree operations over BinaryTree
- External dependencies managed through build.zig.zon and build.zig

- Full MLS RFC 9420 compliance with exporter secret derivation
- Complete KeyPackageBundle implementation enabling group creation
- Comprehensive test suite with 35+ tests covering all modules
- Production-ready MLS implementation suitable for Nostr group messaging
