# MLS Zig Development Notes

## 🎯 **Where to Continue Next**

The foundation is solid! Next logical steps would be:

### **Phase 4: Cryptographic Primitives & Key Packages**
1. **Cipher Suite Framework** - Define supported crypto algorithms (Ed25519, P-256, etc.)
2. **Key Package Structure** - Public keys + credentials for joining groups
3. **Signature Operations** - Integrate with Zig's `std.crypto` for signing/verification
4. **Key Generation** - Create proper key pairs for MLS clients

### **Phase 5: Basic Group Operations**
1. **Leaf Nodes** - Combine credentials + keys + capabilities
2. **Tree Sync** - Maintain group member tree with cryptographic material
3. **Simple Group Creation** - Basic MLS group with 2-3 members

## 🧠 **Key Learnings & Findings**

### **Zig-Specific Insights**
- **Memory Management**: Zig's allocator pattern works excellently for MLS - we can pass allocators down through the call stack for precise memory control
- **Error Handling**: Zig's error unions are perfect for MLS operations that can fail (invalid credentials, crypto errors, etc.)
- **Generics**: Zig's `comptime` generics are more powerful than Rust's for the binary tree - we can parameterize on both data types and behavior
- **Packed Structs**: Will be crucial for wire format compatibility when we implement message parsing

### **Architecture Decisions Made**
- **TLS Codec Pattern**: Our `TlsWriter`/`TlsReader` approach scales well - can easily add more complex types
- **VarBytes Design**: Auto-managing memory for variable-length data works smoothly
- **Index Type Safety**: Wrapper structs prevent index confusion (LeafNodeIndex vs ParentNodeIndex)
- **Diff System**: HashMap-based diffs are more Zig-idiomatic than Rust's BTreeMap approach

### **Performance Notes**
- **Zero-Copy Potential**: Our `VarBytes.asSlice()` returns const references - good for performance
- **Allocation Strategy**: We're allocating sensibly - each component owns its data clearly
- **Iterator Design**: Our iterator pattern avoids heap allocation unlike Rust's `Box<dyn Iterator>`

### **MLS-Specific Insights**
- **Tree Growing Strategy**: Doubling leaf count maintains the full binary tree property correctly
- **Credential Flexibility**: The generic `Credential` wrapper will easily support X.509 certificates later
- **Serialization Compatibility**: Our TLS format matches the spec (big-endian, length-prefixed)

## 🚧 **Technical Debt & Considerations**
- **Error Types**: Consider consolidating error types across modules
- **Allocator Strategy**: May want to explore arena allocators for request-scoped allocations
- **Const Correctness**: Some places could be more const-correct
- **Test Coverage**: Could add property-based testing for tree operations

## 🔧 **Development Setup Notes**
- **Zig Version**: Working with 0.14.1 - stable and reliable
- **Test Strategy**: Each module has comprehensive unit tests - continue this pattern
- **Git Strategy**: Clean commits with descriptive messages work well
- **Sample Code**: Having the OpenMLS Rust reference is invaluable for understanding

## 💡 **Architectural Strengths So Far**
1. **Modularity**: Each component is self-contained with clear interfaces
2. **Type Safety**: Wrapper types prevent common indexing errors
3. **Memory Safety**: Proper RAII patterns with explicit cleanup
4. **Testability**: Good separation allows focused unit testing
5. **Extensibility**: Generic designs will support future MLS extensions

## 🎯 **Immediate Next Session Goals**
1. Start with `cipher_suite.zig` - define the crypto primitives MLS will use
2. Look at Zig's `std.crypto` module for available algorithms
3. Port the cipher suite definitions from OpenMLS
4. Begin implementing key generation and basic signature operations

## 📊 **Current Test Status**
- **Total Tests**: 32 passing
- **Coverage**: All implemented modules have comprehensive tests
- **Patterns**: Each module tests creation, serialization, and core operations

## 🔍 **Useful References**
- **OpenMLS Rust Implementation**: `samples/openmls/` - excellent reference for understanding
- **Zig Standard Library**: `samples/zig/lib/std/` - crypto, TLS, and serialization utilities
- **MLS RFC**: For specification compliance
- **Test Vectors**: Available in `samples/openmls/openmls/test_vectors/` for validation

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy Notes**
- **Unit Tests**: Each module has focused unit tests for its core functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Should add cross-module tests as we build higher-level components
- **Reference Tests**: OpenMLS test vectors will be valuable for compatibility validation
- **Property Testing**: Consider adding property-based tests for tree operations

The codebase is in excellent shape to continue! The foundational work done here will make the cryptographic components much easier to implement.
