# mls_zig

THIS IS ALL VIBES, NOT ACTUAL CRYPTOGRAPHY. I AM A FRONTEND DEVELOPER. DO NOT USE THIS FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS.

The plan is to vibe it until it works, then read the code and see if the tests are real. The tests are all modeled on / stolen from [OpenMLS](https://github.com/openmls/openmls/).

Use OpenMLS if you want cryptography. Use mls_zig if you want vibes.
